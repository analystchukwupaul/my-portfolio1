            I collected and clean the sales data, performed exploratory analysis,And
            <br>built an interactive dashboard that highlights key sales KPI,trends,

            <br>demographics and regional sales performance.I also include slicers
            <br>for user-driven filtering to support dynamic analysis by the marketing
            <br> and sales teams.

            <br>Male buyers accounted for a significant majority of purchased.
            <br>Higher education leve;s correlated with a stronger interest in hign-end bikes.
